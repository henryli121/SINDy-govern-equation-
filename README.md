This project employs the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to identify governing equations from time-series data of three features related to fluid and gas dynamics. This project employs the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to identify governing equations from time-series data of three features related to fluid and gas dynamics. The data is from my previous project titled “[Enhanced Feature Prediction in Time-Series Data Using a Structured Learning Approach](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20082.31686)”. The three features analyzed are: Velocity of Fluid at Output 1, Mass Flow Rate of Gas at Output 1, and Velocity of Gas at Output 2. Using the SINDy algorithm, we reconstruct the underlying mathematical models governing these features by constructing a library of candidate functions, using sparse regression to identify the most relevant terms, and validating the identified equations against the observed data. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of SINDy in discovering simple, interpretable models from complex time-series data, enhancing our understanding of fluid and gas dynamics.
